\frametitle{HERMIT Use Cases}

\begin{itemize}
\item
We want to explore the use of the worker/wrapper transformation for program refinement
\begin{itemize}
\item We need mechanization to be able to scale the idea to larger examples
\item Medium-sized case study: Changing representations in the Conway's Game of Life
\item Are working on large case study: Low Density Parity Checker (LDPC),
tansforming math equations into Kansas Lava programs
\end{itemize}

\item
HERMIT is for library writers
\begin{itemize}
\item Authors show equivalence between clear (specification) code, and efficient (exported) code.
\end{itemize}

\item
HERMIT is a vehicle for prototyping GHC passes

\begin{itemize}
\item
Optimization: Stream Fusion

\item
Optimization: SYB
\item

Staging: Translating Core into CCC combinators. (Elliott, et. al.)
\end{itemize}

\item
Scripting Haskell-based Equational Reasoning -- {\bf this talk}

\item
