\begin{itemize}
\item
There is often a trade-off between the \alert{clarity} and \alert{efficiency} of a program.

\item
Useful to \alert{transform} a clear program (specification) into an efficient program (implementation). 

\item 
This idiom has many instantiations: 
 faster code; 
 using a different interface; 
 space usage;
 semi-formal verification.

\item
We want to \alert{mechanise} such transformations on Haskell programs:
  \begin{itemize}
     \item less time-consuming and error prone than pen-and-paper reasoning
     \item no need to modify the source file
  \end{itemize}

\item
Several existing transformation systems for Haskell programs, e.g. HaRe, HERA, PATH, Ultra.
They all operate on Haskell source code.

\item 
{\bf We take a different approach, and provide commands to transforming \alert{GHC Core}, GHC's intermediate language.}

\end{itemize}
